WSClean Version 1.0
===================

Released 2014-03-15

This is the first public WSClean version. The features currently supported:

* Fast wide-field imaging
* Hogbom cleaning & Cotton-Schwab cleaning
* Joined-polarization cleaning (peak finding in :math:`xx^2+xy^2+yx^2+yy^2`)
* W-snapshot imaging
* Most common weighting modes (uniform, Briggs', natural, super and sub-pixel weighting)
* Adjustable antialising kernel
* All important operations are multi-threaded

A paper has been submitted that shows WSClean's accuracy is at least equal to the w-projection imaging in CASA, and sometimes even better, with a considerable faster imaging time when large w-values are involved.
