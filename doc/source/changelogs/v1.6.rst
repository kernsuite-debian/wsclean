WSClean Version 1.6
===================

Released 2015-01-23

Summary: This version has a few changes that are especially useful for reducing LOFAR data: it supports correcting the LOFAR beam during prediction, and the speed of major iterations on typical LOFAR measurement sets was increased.

When compiling version 1.6, cmake will now search for the LOFAR StationResponse library. If not found, the ``-dft-with-beam`` option will not work.

Full list of changes:

* Feature: It is now possible to do the prediction with a DFT, option ``-dft-prediction``. This is very slow, but allows correcting for a beam.
* Feature: LOFAR beam can be computed, option ``-dft-with-beam``.
* Performance fix: Normal prediction during major iterations is now buffered, which leads to ~3x faster prediction.
* Bugfix: Predicting with option ``-predict`` crashes (reported by N. Hurley-Walker).
* Bugfix: Joined-frequency cleaning with one polarization did not clean negative components.
