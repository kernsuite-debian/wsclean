WSClean version 2.10
====================

Released 2020-07-15

WSClean 2.10 depends on `IDG version 0.7 <https://gitlab.com/astron-idg/idg/-/tags/0.7>`_ or newer.

Summary of changes: WSClean can now run on multiple nodes using MPI. Several new methods for calculating a-terms were added: position-delta screens, better kernel windowing, gridding with the VLA beam and joint deconvolution of multibeam/PAF systems (which was demonstrated using Apertif).

This is the last version that is released via SourceForge. Future development will move to GitLab: https://gitlab.com/aroffringa/wsclean.

Major & visible changes:

* Support for distributed computing using MPI
* Support for "position shift screens" (dldm-screens) during a-correction gridding
* Support for joint deconvolution of PAF / multi-beam observations
* More windowing options for a-correction kernels, defaults now to "raisen Hann"
* The VLA beam has been implemented
* Support imaging of multiple fields
* Add parameter ``-multiscale-max-scales``
* Restore source component models using ``-restore-list``

Bug fixes & other changes:

* Properly weigh channels when averaging with user-set deconvolution channels.
* WSClean could iterate infinitely when first multiscale scale is not 0
* GCC 10 fixes
* Improved error reporting
* Fix inversion timing
